Today I worked on editing the colors and other background information for the website I'm building. I had trouble navigating the different directories, the Hugo quickstart had a slight varriation for exicuting specific commands compared to the webpage guide (Lamp). 

With the help of my roommate we located the correct directory for the colors of this website. Originally it was a lime green color, but we've changed it to a more purple/plum color - #6E003C. The directory was quite hidden, and incredibly difficult to navigate. The code was not very human readable and appeared to be computer generated. 

I connected some various social media accounts, that I believed to be relevent to this project.
